# University-ERP-System
I engineered a multi-tier University ERP system using Java and MySQL, designed to manage complex academic workflows for students, instructors, and administrators. The application features a robust security module with role-based access control and account locking, alongside a dynamic instructor gradebook for automated final grade computation. I implemented advanced database strategies, including soft-deletes for notifications and a global "Maintenance Mode" to ensure data integrity during updates. To deliver a professional user experience, I utilized Java Swing with modern layout managers and custom UI components to create a responsive, semi-transparent interface.
